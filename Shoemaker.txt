Now you've been tucked in
For eternal earthrise and wonder
A sailor through aeons.
Story unheard, howling at the Earth
Yours the whole graveyard of heavens
A ship that sailed home.


You're with us, face of the night
Singing through the morn for mankind
I want to sing with you.
You're home now, outward urge
As with every dreaming creature
We want to come with you.

Here I came to be
Your reach into the far
On the stellar sea
Cut in little stars
